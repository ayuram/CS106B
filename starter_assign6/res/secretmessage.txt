I have a lot of thank you's to make an not enough nanoseconds for the computer to compress all this so I'll just get right to it.
To Trip: Thank you for answering all my questions in class and thank you for remembering that one time in the breakout room where I mentioned the app I was working on. Also thanks for helping me out with this assignment with the whole debug mode thing :)

(To anyone reading)
In case you're curious, the app is called "TeamTrack: FTC Scouting" and its an app meant to keep track of a set of teams competing in the FIRST Tech Challenge tournament, and find what the strengths of each team are.
I first wrote the app in Swift, but then wrote it in Flutter for cross-platform capabilities. I did the UI, marketing, and backend programming for the entire app, and it's one of the projects I'm most proud of.
It's a free app available on both the app store and the play store, and I used every skill I learned in this class to improve the data structures of the app, and the time complexity of all the operations. I'd love to receive your feedback on it!
You can shoot me an email at: ayushsraman@gmail.com or just leave a review on the app page

To Ryan: Thanks for being so easy to approach in section. I remember I came late to section once because of a Comcast moment and had that one question about recursion and how to come up with the base case. Looking back I think it was an easy question, but I think I only see it that way because you clarified my doubts.
